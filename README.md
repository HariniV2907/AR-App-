## Introduction

We are developing Augmented Reality (AR) applications tailored for students from class 1 to class 5. Our aim is to revolutionize the learning experience by incorporating immersive AR technology into the educational curriculum. By integrating AR into the classroom environment, we seek to enhance engagement, understanding, and retention of subjects across various disciplines.
